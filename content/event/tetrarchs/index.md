summary: Invited speaker for Transforming Data Reuse in Archaeology (TETRARCHs) seminar series on "What can data do for us" 
abstract: Growing numbers of archaeologists are interested in implementing data governance principles such as FAIR and CARE in archaeology and digital heritage. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) data governance principles have the potential to transform the way archaeology is practised. In this talk, I will present research with Westbank First Nation archaeologists that enacts Indigenous Data Governance principles in archaeology and digital heritage, and preliminary research to build FAIR+CARE practices for cultural heritage in American archaeology. I will discuss how contextualizing data practice can help build an anti-colonial digital archaeology.
