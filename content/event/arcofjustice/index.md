Anita Lal (Poetic Justice Foundation), Dr Neha Gupta (UBC Okanagan) and Dr Sharanjit Kaur Sandhra (Belonging Matters) have been awarded a Community University Engagement Support (CUES) grant from the University of British Columbia. They will collaborate on bringing a series of community events on anti-racist and anti-casteist narratives with, and alongside multi-faith, multi-lingual South Asian communities residing in the Okanagan, BC. Specifically, the community-university partnership will combine efforts to raise awareness about the intersectional experience of race and caste in workplaces, educational and social spaces, and promote reciprocal learning through community speaker events, a travelling exhibit and teach-in activities alongside diverse communities including domestic and international students and young professionals in the Okanagan.

Join us for the first [event](https://events.humanitix.com/arc-of-justice-evhk24xq) on April 29th at UBC Okanagan.
