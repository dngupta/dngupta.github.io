summary: Presenter in Advancing Practices to Support Ethical Data Management in Archaeology
abstract: This webinar presents ongoing work by the FAIR+CARE Cultural Heritage Network, a group working to investigate, develop, demonstrate, and promote more equitable cultural heritage data curation practices. The Network aims to reconcile the apparent social and technical contradictions between two highly regarded data management principles - CARE (collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics) and FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse). Participants in the Network include representatives from universities, libraries, museums, data repositories, Tribes, state historic preservation offices, professional societies, and cultural resource management firms. The Networkâ€™s four co-directors will discuss activities to date aimed at advancing the capacity of cultural heritage institutions to curate data documenting the histories, landscapes, and cultures of diverse communities in an ethically responsible manner.
