summary: Session Organizer, Engaging Black and Racialized Descendant Communities with Archaeology and Heritage Projects, held at the Canadian Archaeological Association meetings, 2024
abstract: 'The participation of descendant communities is central to the design of research, in meaningful analysis and interpretation of archaeology, and in the appropriate preservation of heritage. In this session, we invite presenters to share projects that engage Black and racialized descendant communities with archaeology and heritage, and discuss how they participate in, and contribute to these projects. Projects can be in any stage of development, including those that have been completed, or that are in the initial stages of conceptualization. We especially encourage students and early career scholars to submit a paper.'
