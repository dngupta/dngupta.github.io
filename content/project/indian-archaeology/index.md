Between 1993 and 2000 the proportion of archaeological investigations in territories north of the Narmada River was greater than those carried out south of the river. The greatest concentration is along the upper Ganges River and at its confluence with the Yamuna River. In these territories, multiple knowledge producers carry out field studies. Investigations led by universities and by state departments are in greater proportion than those led by the Survey. Moreover, we see very few (and if so, sporadic) investigations along the lower Ganges River and in Indiaâ€™s easternmost territories along the Brahmaputra River.
