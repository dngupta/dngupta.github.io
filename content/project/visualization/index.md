Government agencies increasingly share digital data as part of their commitments to Open Government. While well intended, this information is often shared in formats and ways that are not easily understood by non-specialists, Indigenous peoples and members of the general public, nor do they address data governance issues and cultural protocol associated with Indigenous data. Furthermore, communities cannot readily access and use data stored in various repositories for community well-being and decision making about activities that impact the community.
