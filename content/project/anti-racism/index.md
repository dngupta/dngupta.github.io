An on-going collaboration is with Black and racialized archaeologists in the heritage sector, and includes First Nations, government, cultural resource management (CRM), community organizations, museums and academia. A second collaboration is with [Dr Shirley Chau](https://socialwork.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/shirley-chau/) (UBC Okanagan, Social Work). I am invited to participate in [United Against Discrimation](https://kcr.ca/immigrant-services/anti-racism/), a project that works against racism and discrimnation. It seeks "systemic change through social, political and educational action and advocate for both official endorsement of and financial support for these actions."
