The project was based on the principle that a person must have access to health and social services in their first language. Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French-speaking majority. The project focused on service availability for English-speakers, a linguistic minority in the province.

In Phase 1 of this complex multi-year project, I characterized the spatial relationship between health and social service providers and linguistic-minorities in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Because the project aimed to address service inequities through training, the first phase of the project centered on identifying where services for English-speakers were lacking.

The spatial analysis was necessary to better understand the geographic distribution of services providers across the island. I carefully designed maps for a non-specialist audience to present results for social service providers.
