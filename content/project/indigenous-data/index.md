title: Indigenous Data Governance in Digital Heritage
summary: Indigenous data governance draws from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) to re-center Indigenous rights and aspirations in research, policy and practice. In a digital environment, greater attention and deliberate efforts are needed in the governance of data, specifically heritage data that relate to and represent Indigenous communities.

Indigenous data governance principles such as OCAPÂ® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession) and the CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles can provide an ethical framework for developing digital methods and data practices for archaeology in the 21st century.
