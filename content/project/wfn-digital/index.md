title: Digital Heritage Governance at Westbank First Nation
summary: A collaborative project between Westbank First Nation Archaeology and UBC Okanagan that focuses on enacting Indigenous data governance principles such as OCAPÂ® (ownership, control, access and possession) in digital heritage. The principles can help guide appropriate ways to share digital heritage within and beyond Westbank First Nation, while simultaneously supporting community caretaking of its digital heritage.

Through this fellowship, Nancy Bonneau (Westbank First Nation Archaeology) and Dr Neha Gupta (UBC Okanagan) develop a Web-based map that enables engagement and interaction with digital heritage items in Westbank's possession. These community-driven efforts are part of Westbank First Nation Archaeology's broader aims to monitor, preserve and care for heritage within [Westbank First Nation's](https://www.wfn.ca/) area of responsibility and build community capacity in digital methods.

The collaboration is funded by the UBC Okanagan Public Humanities Joint Fellowship and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada.
