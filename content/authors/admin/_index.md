I am Assistant Professor in Anthropology at The University of British Columbia. My research programme examines and addresses geospatial and digital methods in anti-colonial and Indigenous studies of heritage (including archaeology). My research interests are geovisualization and GIS, place-based heritage, data practice, community governance of data, anti-racism and archaeology in India and Canada. I build and expand on these interests through [DARE | Digital Archaeology Research Environment](https://dare-lab.github.io){:target="_blank"}, a Canada Foundation for Innovation laboratory at UBC Okanagan.
