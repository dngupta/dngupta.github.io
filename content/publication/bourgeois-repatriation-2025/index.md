summary: Repatriation in Canada is highly situational, with relatively few regulations in place to assist Indigenous communities in returning their cultural belongings home, let alone to protect their rights as stewards. This paper provides a public policy analysis of repatriation regulations in Canada, with special attention paid to the situation they present to the public, to recommend areas for change.
