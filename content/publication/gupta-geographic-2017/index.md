abstract: Archaeologists are often considered frontrunners in employing spatial approaches
  within the social sciences and humanities, including geospatial technologies such
  as geographic information systems (GIS) that are now routinely used in archaeology.
  Since the late 1980s, GIS has mainly been used to support data collection and management
  as well as spatial analysis and modeling. While fruitful, these efforts have arguably
  neglected the potential contribution of advanced visualization methods to the generation
  of broader archaeological knowledge. This paper reviews the use of GIS in archaeology
  from a geographic visualization (geovisual) perspective and examines how these methods
  can broaden the scope of archaeological research in an era of more user-friendly
  cyber-infrastructures. Like most computational databases, GIS do not easily support
  temporal data. This limitation is particularly problematic in archaeology because
  processes and events are best understood in space and time. To deal with such shortcomings
  in existing tools, archaeologists often end up having to reduce the diversity and
  complexity of archaeological phenomena. Recent developments in geographic visualization
  begin to address some of these issues and are pertinent in the globalized world
  as archaeologists amass vast new bodies of georeferenced information and work towards
  integrating them with traditional archaeological data. Greater effort in developing
  geovisualization and geovisual analytics appropriate for archaeological data can
  create opportunities to visualize, navigate, and assess different sources of information
  within the larger archaeological community, thus enhancing possibilities for collaborative
  research and new forms of critical inquiry.
