summary: In the context of new digital methods and new data, we examine the collection, management, reuse, sharing, and circulation of Indian heritage data, and explore how archaeologists are developing strategies that address growing demands to access data, transparency in knowledge making, and digital publication. We open conversation on an under-examined aspect of heritage research; what happens with the volumes of archaeological documentation (field notes, maps, drawings, illustrations, photos, etc.) after a field season ends, and what strategies do archaeologists employ in keeping track, managing, using, and sharing this information? We consider how digital methods are encouraging archaeologists to learn new ways of practising their craft.
