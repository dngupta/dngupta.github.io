  caption: 'The organization of labour in archaeology in terms of decision making and capacity building. In the field, laboratory and the in digital laboratory, positions that involve decision-making are negatively correlated with the ease of access to capacity; i.e. training for entry-level positions is more easily attained than for specialist positions. Moreover, there is no direct path to becoming a digital specialist from experience in data entry alone. Greater efforts are needed to recruit racialized and Indigenous people into archaeology, and support them into decision-making positions.'
