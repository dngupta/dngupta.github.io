abstract: In this paper, we describe a collaboration between the Westbank First Nation
  Archaeology Office and UBC Okanagan that aims to create digital maps to enable engagement
  with syilx digital heritage and build capacity in digital tools and technologies.
  We examine what data governance frameworks mean for digital heritage and how they
  articulate with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
  (2007) and the First Nations Information Governance Centre’s OCAP® principles. We
  propose digital tools such as open-source and mobile-ready storymaps to showcase
  digital heritage that is appropriate for public sharing, practices that can promote
  and enhance community decision-making, and create training opportunities in digital
  methods in Westbank First Nation. Opening a conversation around digital tools is
  one way that archaeologists can begin to enact Indigenous data governance as a step
  towards dismantling colonial structures and practice in archaeology and digital
  heritage.
