abstract: Forensic and archaeological investigations of human rights violations are
  socially and politically sensitive. They are influenced by the principle of psychic
  unity and by ideas of cultural relativism. Investigations of clandestine graves
  are carried out by interdisciplinary teams working with local communities, national
  institutions and international agencies. Scholars focus on the detection of graves
  and the recovery of victims of crimes. Understanding how and when a grave was created
  takes a secondary position in these scenarios. The present study draws from these
  insights and argues that reconceptualising forensic and archaeological investigations
  in terms of concerns of local communities is a way to understand their changing
  relations with national governments and international organizations.
