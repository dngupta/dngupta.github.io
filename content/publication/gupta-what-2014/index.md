abstract: 'Archaeologists increasingly find themselves confronting members of local
  communities, raising the question: who owns cultural heritage and the interpretation
  of archaeological data? In this paper I introduce geographic information systems
  as a method to gain insight on archaeology. I argue that visualizing where and when
  archaeologists carried out fieldwork is a first step to understand how and why social
  tensions emerge and to address what we have yet to know. Through the case of post-colonial
  India, I present innovative spatial approaches to the history of recent archaeology
  and aim to create the conceptual space to understand how societal factors such as
  political instability and social unrest, national styles of science, competing research
  traditions and culture influenced Indian archaeology.'
