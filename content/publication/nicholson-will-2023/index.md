abstract: A fundamental task of archaeology is to address challenging scientiﬁc questions
  related to the complexity of human societies. If we are to systematically understand
  the processes that affect human societies on multiple spatial and temporal scales,
  research leveraging existing archaeological data is essential. However, only a fraction
  of the data from archaeological projects are publicly ﬁndable or accessible, let
  alone interoperable or reusable. This is the case despite statements of disciplinary
  ethics, availability of capable technologies for data stewardship, publications
  providing guidance, and legal mandates. This article introduces the FAIR principles
  for data stewardship in North American archaeology, which state that data should
  be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We call for efforts to promote
  widespread adoption of the FAIR and CARE (Collective beneﬁt, Authority to control,
  Responsibility, and Ethics) principles among professional organizations, publishers,
  data repositories, and researchers. We also call for adoption and implementation
  of requirements to adhere to these principles by governmental agencies, funding
  bodies, and other regulators of archaeological research. Ultimately, adoption of
  the FAIR principles in an ethical framework contributes to our understanding of
  our human experience and can lead to greater integration and reuse of research results,
  fostering increased partnerships between academia and industry.
